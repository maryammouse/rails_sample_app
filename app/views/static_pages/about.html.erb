<h1>About Us</h1>
<p>
  The <a href="http://railstutorial.org/">Ruby on Rails Tutorial</a>
  is a project to make a book and screencasts to teach web development
  with <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a>. This
  is the sample application for the tutorial.

  This is Maryam Syed's personal version of the app, so expect lots of fun things
  like smileys and things that you would not usually expect.

  (but probably not very exciting things....) :) :) :) XD
